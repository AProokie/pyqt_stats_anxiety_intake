# pyqt_stats_anxiety_intake
A simple clinical intake form for anxiety and categorizing anxiety type, using pyqt5 test project and manual statistics integration (coding more math manually than needed for fun). Used a simple data linear transformation based off of weighting and did a simple t-test for categorizing anxiety type.
